According to the CDC, road accidents are the third top responsible for human mortality, so much so that 170 thousand people died of accidents in the US during the year 2017. The WHO statistics also show that road accidents are one of the top 10 reasons responsible for human mortalities. In fact, according to WHO, the counts of road accident related mortalities have risen up to 2 million people in 2016 (ranked 8th cause of death) from the year 2000's 1.5 million people(ranked 10th cause of death). Many companies and organizations are trying to reduce the fatal injuries of road accidents. These include: urban planning organizations, ministry of health, Police departments,  manufacturers of self-driving and non self-driving cars (i.e BMW, Tesla etc.)
As a Data scientist, I believe a model that predicts road accident severity based on the given appropriate attributes could improve and/or possibly revolutionize these companies/organizations' actions. Below are examples of how such a predictive model could help these companies/organizations.
Urban planning organizations: such an organization could check the safety and quality of the urban roads by giving the road's attributes to the model and receive predictions. The roads whose predictions returned high severity of injuries could be priorotized for rethinking and repair.
Car manufacturing company : These companies could use the cameras and other tools implemented in them to measure features of the road, weather etc. and feed the data to the model and receive predictions. If predictions are indicative of imminent severe accident, the car could do multiple things. For instance, a self driving car would reduce its speed, increase the confidence threshold for a lane changing decision. It could also notify the driver about the danger.
As mentioned above an accident severity predicting model could help different industries.
